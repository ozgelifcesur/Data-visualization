I created this figure as an assignement in Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python course at Coursera.
I learned Python package matplotlib through this course.
It is very small project but it was a good practice in creating interrative charts with matplotlib.
You can find different visualizations of the chart in jupyter notebook and also as png files named as 'y4000.png', 'ygreater40000.png', 'yless40000.png'.

Through this assignment I tried to construct an interactive bar graph which allows the user to click on the y axis to set the value of interest.
The bar colors should change with respect to what value the user has selected.

The challenge was to create an appropriate bar chart that will clearly show which x-axis value is most likely to occur given a y-axis value.
Since the confidence levels overlap and their distributions are different, with a fixed colored bar chart, it is difficult for users to deduce the correct information.
Hence using a colored bar chart with respective confidence intervals and y-levels, my chart made it easier to understand for the users.
