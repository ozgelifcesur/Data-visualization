I created Jupyter notebook as one of my assignments in Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python course at Coursera.
The dataset was provided for Ann Arbor,Michigan, USA.

Through the assignment I first learned to use mplleaflet package to visualize the locations that the temperature data is collected.
Scatter plot is to denote locations. Since it is an interactive plot, I recommend opening the notebook to see it. But I also included general view as 'locations_mapplot.png'.

Second aim was comparing the recorded high and low temperatures in 2015 to temperature trend between 2005-2014.
Hence I used a line plot with days of a year on x-axis and temperatures (C) in y-axis. 
The area between the line graph shows the range of the measured temperatures between 2005-2014.
The record highs and lows in 2015 is show in sccatter plot over the line grap.
You can find above explained graph in 'temp.png' file in this repository.
